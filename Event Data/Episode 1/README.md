**Working with event data**

There are two files provided per episode, containing all the events and alerts generated during the sample execution. There may be events which are unrelated, but are captured as part of the standard event collection.

You can use this data as you see fit, however, the NDJSON file is provided should you wish to load up this data into your own Elasticsearch cluster via Kibana's [file upload feature.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#upload-data-kibana)
