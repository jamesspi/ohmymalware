**Working with event data**

There are two files provided per episode, containing all the events and alerts generated during the sample execution. There may be events which are unrelated, but are captured as part of the standard event collection.

You can use this data as you see fit, however, the NDJSON file is provided should you wish to load up this data into your own Elasticsearch cluster via Kibana's [file upload feature.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#upload-data-kibana)

If you will be uploading to an Elasticsearch cluster via Kibana, please follow these steps.

1. Download the episode's NDJSON file.
2. Go to Kibana -> Home -> Upload a file

3. Upload the downloaded NDJSON file
4. Click on Import at the bottom of the page

5. Switch to the Advanced tab
6. Give your index a name starting with `logs-`. This will ensure it will automatically work with Elastic Security. Do not use a pattern of `log-*-*` as we will not be configuring a data stream.
7. Add an additional index setting - `"mapping.total_fields.limit":"6000"` in the index settings section
8. Replace the contents in the mapping section with the contents of the file `mappings.json` in this repository

9. Click on the import button and wait for it to finish. You should see the following if the upload was successful.

10. You can now view this data in Elastic Security, Discover, or any other area within Kibana. Hint - if you want to filter for this data specifically, use a KQL query that searches specifically for the index you just created, like `_index:"logs-omm_ingested"`
